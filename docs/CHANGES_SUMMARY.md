# Exponential Backoff Implementation - Summary of Changes

## Overview
Implemented exponential backoff for alert notifications to prevent alert fatigue while maintaining quick response to incidents.

## Problem Solved
Previously, alerts were sent repeatedly without any throttling mechanism, causing:
- Alert fatigue from too many notifications
- No way to indicate that an issue is being investigated
- Continuous alerts even when someone is working on the problem

## Solution
Implemented exponential backoff with acknowledgement support:
1. **First alert** sent immediately when service goes down
2. **Subsequent alerts** use exponential backoff: 5s → 10s → 20s → 40s → 80s...
3. **Acknowledgement support** to stop alerts when being investigated
4. **Automatic reset** when service recovers

## Files Modified

### 1. `types.go`
**Changes:**
- Added `FailureCount int` field to `TargetState` struct
- Added `LastAlertTime *time.Time` field to `TargetState` struct
- Modified `checkTarget()` function to implement exponential backoff logic
- Modified `TriggerWebhookTarget()` to initialize new fields
- Modified `RecoverWebhookTarget()` to reset counters on recovery

**Key Logic:**
```go
// Calculate exponential backoff: 5s, 10s, 20s, 40s, 80s, etc.
backoffSeconds := 5 * (1 << uint(state.FailureCount-1))
backoffDuration := time.Duration(backoffSeconds) * time.Second

// Only send alert if:
// 1. Not acknowledged
// 2. Enough time has passed since last alert
if state.AcknowledgedAt == nil && time.Since(*state.LastAlertTime) >= backoffDuration {
    // Send alert
}
```

### 2. `types_test.go`
**Changes:**
- Added `TestTargetState_ExponentialBackoff()` - Tests backoff calculation and state management
- Added `TestTargetState_BackoffTiming()` - Tests timing logic for alerts

### 3. `README.md`
**Changes:**
- Updated Features section to mention exponential backoff
- Added "Advanced Features" section with detailed backoff explanation
- Added backoff timing table showing the progression
- Added acknowledgement configuration example

### 4. `EXPONENTIAL_BACKOFF.md` (New File)
**Purpose:**
- Comprehensive documentation of the exponential backoff feature
- Usage examples and scenarios
- Technical implementation details
- Integration with existing features

## Behavior Changes

### Before
```
Time    Event                Action
-----   ------------------   ----------------------------------
00:00   Target goes down     Alert sent
00:05   Still down           Alert sent (every 5 seconds!)
00:10   Still down           Alert sent
00:15   Still down           Alert sent
00:20   Still down           Alert sent
...     (continues forever)  Alert sent every 5 seconds
```

### After
```
Time    Event                           Action
-----   -----------------------------   ----------------------------------
00:00   Target goes down                Alert sent immediately (failure #1)
00:05   Still down, 5s passed          Alert sent (failure #2)
00:15   Still down, 10s passed         Alert sent (failure #3)
00:35   Still down, 20s passed         Alert sent (failure #4)
01:15   Still down, 40s passed         Alert sent (failure #5)
02:35   Still down, 80s passed         Alert sent (failure #6)
02:40   User acknowledges alert        Alerts STOP (even though still down)
05:00   Still down                     No alert (acknowledged)
10:00   Still down                     No alert (acknowledged)
11:00   Target recovers                All clear sent, counters reset
11:30   Target goes down again         Alert sent immediately (new incident)
```

## Testing

All tests pass:
```bash
$ go test -v -run TestTargetState
=== RUN   TestTargetState_ExponentialBackoff
--- PASS: TestTargetState_ExponentialBackoff (0.00s)
=== RUN   TestTargetState_BackoffTiming
--- PASS: TestTargetState_BackoffTiming (0.00s)
PASS
```

Full test suite:
```bash
$ go test -v ./...
PASS
ok  	github.com/bevelwork/quick_watch	0.009s
```

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully backward compatible**
- No configuration changes required
- Existing configurations continue to work
- New fields have sensible defaults (0/nil)
- Acknowledgement feature is optional (opt-in via `acknowledgements_enabled`)

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Alert Fatigue**: Progressive backoff prevents notification spam
2. **Faster Initial Response**: First alert sent immediately for quick action
3. **Acknowledgement-Aware**: Team members can signal they're investigating
4. **Automatic Recovery**: System resets when service recovers
5. **No Configuration**: Works automatically out of the box
6. **Scalable**: Backoff continues to grow (preventing runaway alerts)

## Usage

No changes needed for basic usage. The exponential backoff is automatic.

To enable acknowledgements:
```yaml
settings:
  acknowledgements_enabled: true
```

## Performance Impact

**Minimal**: 
- Two additional integer/pointer fields per target state
- Simple arithmetic calculation (bit shift operation)
- No additional goroutines or timers
- No impact on healthy targets

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

Potential future improvements:
- Configurable backoff multiplier (currently fixed at 5 seconds)
- Configurable backoff base (currently 2^n)
- Max backoff cap (currently unlimited growth)
- Custom backoff strategies per target
- Alert escalation after N failures
